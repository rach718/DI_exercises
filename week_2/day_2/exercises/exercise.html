<!-- Daily challenge :
Using this array,
var array = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"];

Remove the Banana from the array.
Sort the array in order.
Put “Kiwi” at the end of the array.
Remove “Apples” from the array.
Sort the array in reverse order. (Not alphabetical, but reverse (the current Array i.e. [‘a’, ‘c’, ‘b’] becomes [‘b’, ‘c’, ‘a’])
you should have at the end:
[“Kiwi”, “Oranges”, “Blueberries”]

 var array2 = ["Banana", ["Apples", ["Oranges"], "Blueberries"]];
1. console.log “Oranges”.

<!-- Gold Challenge, Ninja Challenge, and in-class challenges: -->

<!-- Exercise 1:
Ask a number to the user, and save it to a variable.
Check if the variable is an even number
If yes, display: “x is an even number’. Where x is the actual number of the user
If no, display “x is not an even number’. Where x is the actual number of the user -->


<!-- Exercise 2:
Create 2 variables, x and y =. Each of them has a different numeric value
Write an if/else statement that display the bigger number -->


<!-- Exercise 3:
Ask the user which language he speaks
Create a few conditions :
If he speaks French : display “Bonjour”
If he speaks English : display “Hello”
If he speaks Hebrew : display “Shalom”
If he doesn’t speak none of these 3 languages: display “😊” -->

<!-- Exercise 4:
Ask the user for his grade
If the score is bigger than 90, console.log ‘A’
If the score is between 80 and 90, console.log ‘B’
If the score is between 70 and 80, console.log ‘C’
If the score is lower than 70, console.log ‘D’ -->


<!-- Exercise 5:
var me = [“my”,”favorite”,”color”,”is”,”blue”]
1. Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string
 -->


<!-- 
//Exercise 6:
Create a string
If the length of this string is at least 3, it should add ‘ing’ to its end, unless it already ends in ‘ing’, in which case it should add ‘ly’ instead.
If the string length is less than 3, it should leave it unchanged.
For example:
The string is : ‘swim’ , your program should console.log : ‘swimming’
The string is : ‘swimming’, your program should console.log : ‘swimmingly’
The string is : ‘go’ your program should console.log : ‘go’
 -->


<!-- Exercise 7: -->
<!--  Create a string that has the word “not” and “bad” inside
Create another variable that should find the first appearance of the substring ‘not’ and ‘bad’.
If the ‘bad’ follows the ‘not’, then it should replace the whole ‘not’…’bad’ substring with ‘good’ than console.log the result.
If it doesn’t find ‘not’ and ‘bad’ in the right sequence (or at all), just console.log the original sentence.
For example:
Your string is : ‘This dinner is not that bad!’, the result is : ‘This dinner is good!’
Your string is : ‘This movie is not so bad!’ the result is : ‘This movie is good!’
Your string is : ‘This dinner is bad!’ the result is : ‘This dinner is bad!’ -->


<!-- Exercise 8: -->
<!-- 
// change everything below to the newer Javascript!
​
// let + const
var a = 'test';
var b = true;
var c = 789;
a = 'test2';
 -->

Exercise 9:
// console log firstName lastName age eyeColor,num,city
var person = {
    firstName : "John",
    lastName  : "Doe",
    age       : 50,
    eyeColor  : "blue",
    id:{
      num:909090,
      add:{
        city:'tel aviv'
      }
    }
};
​


​//Exercise 10:
// add a default argument to the function
// set default age to 10;
​
function isValidAge(age) {
    return age
}
alert (isValidAge() );
​
​

//Exercise 11:
// Change to Arrow functions
function whereAmI(username, location) {
    if (username && location) {
        return "I am not lost";
    } else {
        return "I am totally lost!";
    }
}


Exercise 12:

// For all of these, what is the value of when the function gets called with the alert()
/ For all of these, what is the value of when the function gets called with the alert()
// #1
// function q1() {
//     var a = 5;
//     if(a > 1) {
//         a = 3;
//     }
//     alert(a);
// } 
// ​
// ​
// #2
// var a = 0;
// function q2() {
//     a = 5;
// }
// function q22() {
//     alert(a);
// }
// ​
// ​
// #3
// function q3() {
//     window.a = "hello";
// }
// function q32() {
//     alert(a);

// #4
// var a = 1;

Exercise 13:
//#1 change this function into a ternary and assign it to variable called experiencePoints
function experiencePoints() {
    if (winBattle()) {
        return 10;
    } else {
        return 1;

//Using this function, answer the questions below:
function moveCommand(direction) {
    var whatHappens;
    switch (direction) {
        case "forward":
            break;
            whatHappens = "you encounter a monster";
        case "back":
            whatHappens = "you arrived home";
            break;
            break;
        case "right":
            return whatHappens = "you found a river";
            break;
        case "left":
            break;
            whatHappens = "you run into a troll";
            break;
        default:
            whatHappens = "please enter a valid direction";
    }
    return whatHappens;
}
​
//#2 return value when moveCommand("forward");
​
//#3 return value when moveCommand("back");
​
//#4 return value when moveCommand("right");
​
//#5 return value when moveCommand("left");
​
//BONUS: practice makes perfect. Go and write your own switch function. It takes time to get used to the syntax!
